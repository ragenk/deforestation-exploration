**1. GLOBAL SITUATION**

a.   What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 1990? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record denoted as “World" in the region table.

```sql
SELECT forest_area_sqkm
FROM forest_area
WHERE country_name = 'World' and year = '1990';
```

b.   What was the total forest area (in sq km) of the world in 2016? Please keep in mind that you can use the country record in the table denoted as “World.”

```sql
SELECT forest_area_sqkm
FROM forest_area
WHERE country_name = 'World' and year = '2016';
```

c.    What was the change (in sq km) in the forest area of the world from 1990 to 2016?

```sql
SELECT country_code,
			 year,
		   forest_area_sqkm,
		   LEAD(forest_area_sqkm) OVER (ORDER BY forest_area_sqkm) - forest_area_sqkm AS area_change
FROM forest_area
WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year IN ('1990', '2016')
```

d.    What was the percent change in forest area of the world between 1990 and 2016?

```sql
SELECT ((LEAD(forest_area_sqkm) OVER (ORDER BY forest_area_sqkm) - forest_area_sqkm)/
			 (
				SELECT forest_area_sqkm 
			  FROM forest_area
			  WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year = '1990'
				))*100 AS area_percentage_change
FROM forest_area
WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year IN ('1990', '2016')
```

               total_area_sq_mi*2.59 as total_area_sqkm
        FROM land_area
				WHERE year = '2016'
  			)
SELECT country_name,
		   total_area_sqkm
FROM t1
WHERE total_area_sqkm <= (
        SELECT LEAD(forest_area_sqkm) OVER (ORDER BY forest_area_sqkm) - forest_area_sqkm AS area_change
        FROM forest_area
        WHERE country_name = 'World' AND year IN ('1990', '2016')
